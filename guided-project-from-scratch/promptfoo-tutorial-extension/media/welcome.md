# 🚀 Welcome to Language Learning AI Evaluation!

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to evaluate and optimize AI models for language learning applications using **Promptfoo**. 

## 🎯 What is Promptfoo?

Promptfoo is a powerful testing framework that helps you:
- **Compare** different AI models side-by-side
- **Test** prompts with real-world scenarios
- **Measure** quality with automated assertions
- **Optimize** for accuracy, speed, and cost

## 🌍 Our Language Learning Demo App

This tutorial is based on a real language learning application that uses AI to:

### 📝 Text-Based Practice
- **Grade** student answers using GPT-4o-mini
- **Provide feedback** using Google's Gemini
- **Identify mistakes** in grammar and vocabulary
- **Track progress** from 1-10 scoring

### 🖼️ Image-Based Learning
- **Analyze** uploaded images with Gemini Vision
- **Evaluate** student descriptions in target language
- **Suggest vocabulary** based on visual context
- **Provide contextual feedback**

## 💡 Why Evaluate AI Models?

When building language learning apps, you need to ensure:
- ✅ **Accurate grading** - Students get fair assessments
- ✅ **Helpful feedback** - Constructive and encouraging
- ✅ **Consistent quality** - Reliable across different scenarios
- ✅ **Safe content** - Appropriate for all learners

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

By the end of this tutorial, you'll know how to:

1. **Set up Promptfoo** for language learning evaluation
2. **Compare GPT-4 vs Gemini** for educational tasks
3. **Write test cases** for grading and feedback
4. **Add quality assertions** to ensure accuracy
5. **Optimize costs** while maintaining quality
